My name is Abnel Negron. I graduated from Rutgers University over a year ago and am very eager to start my career in the tech industry. I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. Being a military brat, I have traveled all around the world and that has given me perspective on different people can be and I will always try to understand them. Making me work well in groups and understand what needs to be done in a timely matter. With all this in mind, learning and discovering new technologies/techniques to further expand my knowledge is my goal to become a better person and experience everything that life has to offer.
